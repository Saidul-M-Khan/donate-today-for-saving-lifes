                <p>
                    Food is a basic necessity for survival and also the key to a healthy life. Without regular healthy
                    meals children struggle to go to school, carers struggle to work and communities are left battling
                    to survive.

                    The system has three levelsâ€”primary, secondary, and higher education. Primary and secondary
                    education are both compulsory, though universal participation has remained more an ideal than a
                    fact.

                <p>
                    Following a severe flood in early June that affected around 4 million people, the same area was
                    struck
                    by record-breaking rains beginning on June 15. The majority of Sylhet has been submerged once more,
                    with
                    water levels continuing to rise, aggravating the situation of people still living in temporary
                    shelters
                    and exposing them to harsh weather and waterborne infections.<br><br>

                However, further assistance from philanthropic organizations and development partners is urgently
                required. As the days pass, the demand for rescue and aid grows in flood-affected communities. A
                coordinated humanitarian response would substantially supplement the government's efforts to provide
                targeted humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable populations.<br><br>
